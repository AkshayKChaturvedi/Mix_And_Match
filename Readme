Problem Statement: Model the android dialler keyboard in software(no GUI required) to capture interaction with the keyboard 
and output best matches and possible suggestions.

To generate possible suggestions, create dictionary which consists of all possible 3 letter words that can be created from 
the 26 characters such that the resultant 3 letters have at-least one vowel and has no duplicate characters.

The program should accept any 3 digits(duplicates allowed) string and generate a best match and possible combinations. The 
best match is the string with the max number of vowels followed by an ascending order in case of equality.

This folder contains 2 files:

1. Mix_And_Match.py - It contains all the necessary function to achieve the tasks as mentioned in problem statement.
2. Mix_And_Match_tests.py - It contains tests to validate the functioning of the code.
